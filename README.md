# Build a real-time newsletter signup form with Rails and Turbo

For nearly every meaningful project I've taken on, there's always been a landing page first to help me market and semi-validate an idea.

Tons of tools exist to capture email and market to that audience, but I've always been bothered by the lack of control of that data and how we blindly hand it over to services like Mailchimp, Mailerlite, ConvertKit, etc...

Those tools save you time and enable you to focus on your project, but I commonly like to keep that stuff in-house. That way, as my project scales, so can my marketing tactics.

Collecting a simple email address for the purpose of a newsletter seems super downright and straightforward overkill for Rails. Still, in this guide, Iâ€™ll show you some techniques to make the process snappy and more delightful than the legacy ways involving page refreshes and redirects.
